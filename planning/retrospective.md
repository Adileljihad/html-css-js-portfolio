# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- _Stop wasting time on overly complex designs or features that aren’t necessary for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)._  
  **Explanation:** Initially, I spent too much time creating overly complex designs and adding features that weren’t essential for the base version of the portfolio. I’ve learned that keeping the design simple but functional helps stay focused on the main goals and leads to a better result.

- _Stop trying to perfect small details in early stages._  
  **Explanation:** I spent a lot of time trying to perfect minor details like transitions and hover effects early on, while I should have focused more on building the basic structure and core functionality.

## Continue Doing

- _Continue following a structured, methodical approach to development._  
  **Explanation:** I followed an organized process to develop the portfolio, and the strategy that guided me day by day worked effectively. Planning the user stories and roadmap beforehand helped me stay focused and motivated during development.

- _Continue iterating on design and functionality._  
  **Explanation:** Every phase of the project saw a refinement of both the design and the functionality, not only visually but also from a technical perspective. Continuously iterating allowed me to see improvements as they were applied.

- _Continue testing on multiple devices and screen sizes._  
  **Explanation:** Testing the portfolio on various devices was essential to ensure responsiveness. Continuing these tests helped detect and fix issues related to display on both small and large screens.

## Start Doing

- _Start learning from mistakes earlier and using that feedback actively._  
  **Explanation:** An important lesson I learned is that analyzing mistakes early would have helped me make quicker corrections. Accepting early feedback helps to grow faster as a developer.

- _Start collecting user feedback, even if it's just for small improvements._  
  **Explanation:** Even though I didn’t have a team to gather feedback from, seeking suggestions from trusted people (like friends or colleagues) would have given me fresh perspectives and led to improvements.

## Lessons Learned

- _Be patient and persistent._  
  **Explanation:** One important lesson I learned was to not get discouraged when things didn’t go as planned. Every mistake is an opportunity for growth. Especially when working alone, patience is key to achieving the final result.

- _Prioritize simplicity and focus on core features first._  
  **Explanation:** I realized that to avoid wasting time on unnecessary features, it’s important to focus on the essential elements first. A clean and functional design is more valuable than an overly elaborate one.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- _Errors in the markdown file were expected during the first drafts but helped refine the final formatting._  
  **Explanation:** I knew I would encounter errors in the documentation, particularly with markdown formatting. But they were a natural part of the learning process, and once corrected, the final file became more readable and well-structured.

- _The homepage design turned out as planned, clear with accessible sections._  
  **Explanation:** The homepage design went as expected, thanks to a clear planning of the layout and good management of spacing.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- _The initial time estimation for completing the project was slightly off._  
  **Explanation:** I thought I would finish the project sooner, but I realized that many details take more time than expected, especially during debugging and testing.

- _Had challenges with implementing some advanced CSS animations._  
  **Explanation:** I hadn’t anticipated some challenges when implementing advanced CSS animations. It ended up taking more time than planned. In the future, I should focus on fundamental animations rather than overcomplicating them.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- _Yes, I needed to add more focus on accessibility features for the design to be universally usable._  
  **Explanation:** While I had planned for a responsive design, I hadn’t considered accessibility (contrast, alternative text for images, etc.) enough. Adding these features became necessary and greatly improved the user experience for everyone.

- _Yes, I realized I needed to incorporate dynamic content, such as the project details and the skillset progress bar._  
  **Explanation:** Initially, I hadn’t considered including dynamic elements. Adding a section for dynamically loaded project details and a visual skillset tracker improved user interaction.

### Or remove extra steps?

- _No, I kept all steps as initially planned, focusing on the basics first, and this strategy worked well._  
  **Explanation:** Although some steps initially seemed unnecessary, they were crucial for ensuring the site was well-structured and easy to extend in the future.

# Constraints

Some boundaries about my project

## External

- No external constraints as the project is purely personal and self-driven.

## Internal: Involuntary

- _Time_
  - Due to my individual commitment, time for research, development, and implementation of new features is limited, resulting in the need to prioritize essential functionalities.

## Internal: Voluntary

- _Coding Style Novice_
  - Since I am a beginner in web development, I am still learning best practices and applying basic coding structures that may evolve as my skills grow.
